Wk7 Assignment:

I’ve not been able to get the server on render to show the same data I see in localhost:8080/cakes. I can get it to connect to https://wk7-bakemydaytoo-server.onrender.com/ and show the “route route” but “/cakes” does not work.
I’ve built and rebuilt, tried different connections. The link and password are correct.
The error is currently showing Error: connect ECONNREFUSED ::1:5432. I have searched for an answer to this and I do not understand the fixes suggested.

I’ve not given up yet, and what you see does not reflect the number of hours I have worked on this assignment so far. It is missing form code as I run out of available time to add the form code. This means that the form won’t work (even if the server part was working!) – its included as a placeholder.

I achieved the following requirements:
Its fast and responsive and the form is simple.
You can view multiple pages
I have built a database schema and seeded the database.
You can view all the posts and I have used .map to display all the posts (from the seeded data).
In addition it looks like a good start, with a nice design and it transfers to a mobile view nicely.

My stretch goals are:
To have a sort function – currently the boxes are displayed in alphabetical order by cake type.
To have a filter function and a dropdown pick list on the form for type of cake. Feeding in a cake-based API might be useful and is worth investigating also.
Add images into SQL and the ability for members to upload images.
Add the comment feature.

Note regarding the SupaBase Schema:
The schema shows 3 individual tables not connected to each other. If I’d managed to the stretch goals I would need to make sure the ids are represented in the relevant tables to join the necessary data items together. As it is, I could be where I am now with one single table.

Thank you
